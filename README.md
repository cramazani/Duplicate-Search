# Duplicate-Search
A framework to search potential duplicates of metabolomics data and other HILIC artifacts. 

## Description

Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC) data are collected with information about feature mass and retention time (RT). However, it is not always obvious how to select which features are potential duplicates of each other and peaks that represent non-biological artifacts (e.g. salts) originating from the HILIC  analysis. 

This work is an attempt at a reproducible framework to identify potential metabolite duplicates and HILIC artifacts. The workflow of this particular quest consists of 3 sets of conditions (See section below).

In order to extract potential duplicate pairs and those related to specific HILIC articfacts, we will apply a set of condition to our data.
